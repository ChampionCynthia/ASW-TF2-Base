The Swarm SDK Template implements the Orange Box SDK Template into Alien Swarm, and nothing more. It is the ideal swarm-free base from which to build your own new game.

This mod only requires **swarm\_base**!
(Meaning you can make a true mod using Alien Swarm).

## Usage ##
**build/** includes the compiled build and assets for your new mod.
Check out to **`Steam/steamapps/SourceMods/swarmsdktemplate`**

**src/** includes the full source code.
Check out anywhere you want.

Open **swarm\_sdk\_template.sln** to get started.

Launch the mod with **-override\_vpk** until I release it with vpk's.

## Requirements ##
  * Alien Swarm (free)
    * http://store.steampowered.com/app/630/
